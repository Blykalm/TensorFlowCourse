# TensorflowCourse
Code from a course I am following on how to use Tensorflow to create ML

The course that I am following is from Daniel Bourke on youtube, it is about 14 hours long and I will be adding all of the code that I will be writing to GitHub so that I can also learn how to use GitHub.
the link to the course is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCFfeUEGs8&list=WL&index=1&t=4959s , for anybody who is also interested in learning how to use TensorFlow.
